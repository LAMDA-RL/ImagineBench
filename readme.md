# RIMARO: Benchmark for <u>R</u>einforcement Learning from <u>Ima</u>ginary <u>Ro</u>llouts

[![Project Status: Early Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-early%20development-orange)](https://github.com/yourusername/offline-rl-imaginary-rollouts)

## Overview

A benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms that train the policies using **imaginary rollouts** from LLMs. The concept of imaginary rollouts was proposed by [KALM](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tb1MlJCY5g) in NeurIPS 2024, which focuses on extracting knowledge from LLMs, in the form of environmental rollouts, to improve RL policies' performance on novel tasks. Please check the paper for more details.

**Core focus**: Measuring how well agents can learn effective policies through LLM's imaginary rollouts and generalize well on novel tasks.

## ðŸš§ Dataset Status

**Coming Soon!**  
We are actively preparing:

- Multiple environment domains
- Paired real+LLM-generated trajectories
- Varying task difficulty levels
